## React test code

This project delivers a scalable and modular e-commerce solution, integrating backend, frontend, and AWS. The use of NestJS, MongoDB, and React ensures high performance and flexibility, while Serverless and LocalStack enable optimization and scalability.

With a robust architecture, the system provides full CRUD operations, image uploads to S3, and order analytics with aggregated metrics. The React frontend offers a user-friendly interface, enhanced with Material UI and Storybook for component documentation.

By leveraging Docker for local environment setup and Serverless Framework for Lambda functions, this project is efficient, cloud-ready, and easy to maintain.
